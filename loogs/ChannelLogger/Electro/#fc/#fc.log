2014-02-08T06:36:12  <[FC]> Can you tell me, if I have one version of Python on server for global use, and I setup another version that will be used by just one user (local instalation) is it going to take same CPU resources or CPU will go crazy? xD
2014-02-08T06:36:37  <[FC]> And MEM ofc

2014-02-09T00:42:10  <Iota> eh?
2014-02-09T03:09:13  <[FC]> I never had a harder night in my fucking life
2014-02-09T03:09:29  <[FC]> installing Python locally took me ~8 hours
2014-02-09T03:10:54  <Iota> o.o
2014-02-09T03:11:13  <[FC]> _sqlite3
2014-02-09T03:11:26  <[FC]> I've installed Python before that one
2014-02-09T03:11:44  <[FC]> And it couldn't do anything
2014-02-09T03:11:51  <[FC]> (with supy I mean)
2014-02-09T03:12:05  <[FC]> Because you must have _sqlite3 available to start supy
2014-02-09T03:12:34  <[FC]> And I didn't know that first I have to install SQLite and then Python
2014-02-09T03:13:05  <[FC]> So I was trying to fix it with pip, sqlite3, pysqlite, sqlite3-dev
2014-02-09T03:13:15  <[FC]> And I lost almost 8 fucking hours
2014-02-09T03:14:17  <[FC]> Now I'm transferinf supy folders to my PC, I'll install clean supy, modules that I need and then I'll return my stable supy version on the server and run it
2014-02-09T03:14:36  <[FC]> And I'll be able to modify those standard modules shipped with supy
2014-02-09T03:14:48  <[FC]> Like irlib.py, Owner plugin etc.
2014-02-09T03:15:04  <[FC]> At least that's what I hope I'll be able to do
2014-02-09T03:15:47  <[FC]> Except I'll delete everything, even my shell accs, I'll go off the IRC forever and I'll dump my PC and start living healthy life :)
2014-02-09T03:16:36  <[FC]> I have to find someone for Skype or my head is going to explode
