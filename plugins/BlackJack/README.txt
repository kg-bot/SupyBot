Ordinary BlackJack game.

Player can play only one instance of the game in same time.

Player must have enough chips to backup his stake.

When the player places bet and starts a game chips are taken away from him, if he wins
initial stake and bonus are added back to his account.

Each dealer and player are dealt two cards in the begining.

We make a check for blackjack after first two cards are dealt.

If nobody has blackjack we must wait for the player to hit/double or stand.

Player can decide what to do until he stands or he's busted.

When the player stands we start to deal cards to dealer until he reaches 17 or higher.

If the dealer is busted then player winns the game and we calculate the prize.

If the dealer is not busted and he's reached 17 we compare player and dealer score and calculate winner.
