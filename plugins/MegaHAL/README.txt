Please note that this plugin is *unstable*.
It may introduce bugs into your Supybot, and you'll have to restart it in
order to solve them.
It makes *the whole bot* upper case all s, r, and p (it decides randomly what
it want to upper case), and doesn't care whether they are incoming or
outgoing.
For example, if your password has the letter "s" and the bot "decided" to
capitalize the s, you won't be able to identify.
